PrefsPane
=========

ABOUT:

"PrefsPane" is a Cocoa sample System Preferences pane bundle that demonstrates how to use the NSPreferencePane class.  It is designed to help you get started in writing your own preference pane.  It also shows you all the necessary delegate methods and other methods you need to override to achieve the functionality you need.


USING THE SAMPLE:

Simply build the project using Xcode and run System Preferences from the Apple Menu.  Your preference pane bundle is automatically added to ~/Library/PreferencePanes.
You will then see "PrefsPane" in the bottom section called "Other".  It contains two preference settings: 1) a string, 2) a boolean.  The boolean value determines whether or not to display a warning alert before exiting.
